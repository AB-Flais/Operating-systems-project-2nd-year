This page has been written and tested on chrome v. 108.0.5359.125 (official build) (64 bits)

The code has been written assuming a correct format of the input file

Those instants that aren't shown are exactly the same as the previous ones

Possibly poor documentation is due to my inexperience with projects like this

Personalization:
  - The background can be disabled by changing the --background variable in master.css ninth line as  indicated
  - the variable colors in listConstructor.js is an array that contains the colors that each new partition will have (excluding the empty ones).
    It loops, so when the fifth is already used it comes back to the first. The code is ready for its length to be changed, feel free to add or remove colors.



To start running the code, open the file gestormemoria.html with your favorite web browser, and Enjoy! ;)
